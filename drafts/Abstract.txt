The partitioned graph coloring problem is a generalization of the standard graph coloring problem, in which the set $V$ of nodes is partitioned into $P = \{ P_1, \ldots, P_q \}$ subsets, and only one node per partition must be colored. The main application of this problem is wavelength routing and assignment in Wavelength Division Multiplexed optical networks.

In this paper we present a binary integer programming formulation for this problem, extending the CP model presented by Méndez-Díaz and Zabala for the coloring problem in previous publications. We present an analysis of the polytope spanned by the model as well as a number of valid inequalities and facets.

In order to determine the computational efficiency of these inequalities we implemented a simple cut and branch algorithm by applying some of the obtained cuts and standard branching rules.
