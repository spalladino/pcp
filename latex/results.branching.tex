\subsection{Branching strategies}
\label{subsec:resultsbranching}

\begin{itemize}
\item Static priorities: See branchstatic1, S4 wins, dont include tables
\item Dynamics: Compare fractional, dsatur, with and without color consec; both dsatur win, regardless consec color, gap found better, dont compare with gap
\item Bounds: Once dsatur is fixed, try with and without fixing bounds, see fixing works much better
\item Remark statics are faster than dynamics due to processing time
\end{itemize}
